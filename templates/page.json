Information you manually provide: We collect the information, including PII, you manually provide (using your keyboard, touch-pad, and\/or mouse) when you use our online platforms. At various places on the Website or mobile application, we may request certain PII, such as your name, phone number, email, billing address, and shipping address. You may choose to provide PII to access or use certain features or services of the online platforms, such as making a purchase, registering on the Website or mobile application, entering a contest or sweepstakes, filling out a survey, or providing Feedback. Where possible, we indicate which fields of information are required and which fields are optional. You can always choose not to provide information, but you may not be able to use a particular service or feature on the Website or mobile application. Information from third-party social media platforms: You may be able to register with, log on to, or enhance your profile on our Website or mobile application by choosing to automatically populate the requested data fields with information you previously provided to a third-party social media platform.

We treat that information as we do any other information you give to us when you register, log on, or enhance your profile.<\/p><p><\/p><p><strong>Information sent to us by your web browser:<\/strong><\/p><p>We collect information that is sent to us automatically by your web browser. It typically includes your IP address, the address of the web page you were visiting when you accessed our online platforms, the name of your operating system, the name and version of your browser, and the date and time of your visit. The information we receive depends on the settings on your web browser. Please check your browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings. We use this information to improve the Content and functionality of this platform, and to better understand and serve our visitors. The information we receive from your web browser does not, in and of itself, identify you personally. However, we may combine it with other information in an attempt to identify you or we may combine it with information that does identify you.<\/p><p><strong>Information from your mobile or tablet device:<\/strong><\/p><p>Likewise, if you download one of our mobile or tablet applications or access our Website through your mobile or tablet device, we may automatically collect certain information from or about your device. The types of information we may collect include the type of device you use, the IP address of your device, your device’s operating system, the type of mobile or tablet Internet browsers you use, and information about the way you use our mobile or tablet application. Information collected using “Cookies” and other web technologies: Most websites use “cookies” and\/or similar technologies to place information about a user’s visit to that website in a small data file that is stored on the user’s computer. Some browsers automatically accept cookies, but you may be able to configure your browser to prevent the use of cookies. Apollo Brands may use cookies to make our services available or easier for you to use. For instance, we may use cookies to store preferences or items in your shopping cart between visits. PII may be among the types of information stored in a cookie. For example, if you choose the “remember me” option when logging on, we may store your email address in a cookie to expedite your future log-ons. We may also use cookies for the purpose of delivering “first party” advertisements to you. Acceptance of cookies is not a requirement to browse our Website or mobile application, however certain features and services may require the use of cookies to work properly, including our shopping cart and check-out features. If you would like to place an order on our Website without the use of cookies, please email csunderarmour@apollobrands.co.za.<\/p><p>In addition to cookies, we may also use “web beacons” and other web technologies to manage our Website and email. A web beacon is a small bit of computer code. Web beacons may be used to count how many people visit a web page or tell us whether an email has been opened. We may link the information we collect using web beacons and other web technologies to PII.<\/p><p><strong>More Information on “First Party” Advertising<\/strong><\/p><p>First-party advertising works this way: When you visit our online platforms, we may deliver a cookie to your browser. When you leave our Website and travel elsewhere on the Internet, we may use the cookie to recognise you as someone who has visited our Website, to assume that you are interested in our products, and to deliver an advertisement to you that promotes our products. Although we may work with a vendor to deliver and read our first-party cookies and to serve advertisements on our behalf, our vendors may not use these first-party cookies to recognise you as someone who may be interested in the goods\/services of the vendors’ other clients. You can opt out of first-party advertising by visiting your account page. When you do, we will deliver an “opt-out” cookie to your browser. When you visit our Website in the future, the opt-out cookie will tell us that you have opted out of Apollo Brands’ cookies for first-party targeted advertisements.<\/p><p>Please note that the opt-out cookie will only prevent delivery of first-party advertising cookies. First-party cookies are different than third-party cookies. Third-party cookies track your online behaviours across non-affiliated websites for the purpose of delivering targeted advertisements not only for Apollo Brands but for a variety of other companies. To learn more about online behavioural advertising and the choices you have about the delivery of third-party cookies, read the next section.<\/p><p><strong>Cookies Delivered by Third Parties<\/strong><\/p><p>In addition to the cookies we deliver to your computer through our Website, certain third parties may deliver cookies to you for a variety of reasons.

Other third parties may deliver cookies to your computer for the purpose of tracking your online behaviours across non-affiliated websites and delivering targeted advertisements either on our website or on other websites.<\/p><p>You have choices about the collection of information by third parties on our online platforms.

Please note that the Add-on does not prevent information from being sent to Apollo Brands.<\/p><p>In addition, if you would like to opt-out of having interest-based information collected by certain entities during your visits to our online platforms, please click here. You will be directed to an industry-developed website that contains mechanisms for choosing whether each listed entity may collect and use data for online behavioural advertising purposes. It may be that some of the third parties that collect interest-based information on our online platforms do not participate in the industry-developed opt-out website, in which case the best way to avoid third-party tracking of your online behaviours may be through your browser settings and deletion of cookies. Please note that the industry-developed opt-out mechanism described above is device specific. If you wish to opt-out from having interest-based information collected by participating entities across all devices, you need to visit the opt-out page from each device.<\/p><p><strong>Our Use of Your Information<\/strong><\/p><p>Generally, we use the information we collect through our Website and online application:<\/p><ul><li>to provide the information, products and services you request;<\/li><li>to provide you with effective customer service;<\/li><li>to provide you with a personalised experience when you use our online platforms;<\/li><li>to contact you with information and notices related to your use of our online platforms;<\/li><li>to contact you with special offers and other information we believe will be of interest to you (in accordance with any privacy preferences you have expressed to us);<\/li><li>to invite you to participate in surveys and provide Feedback to us (in accordance with any privacy preferences you have expressed to us);<\/li><li>to improve the Content, functionality and usability of our online platforms;<\/li><li>to better understand your needs and interests;<\/li><li>to improve our products and services;<\/li><li>to improve our marketing and promotional efforts;<\/li><li>for security, credit or fraud prevention purposes;<\/li><li>for any other purpose identified in an applicable privacy notice, click-through agreement or other agreement between you and us.<\/li><\/ul><p>More information on how we use PII collected as part of a contest or promotion.
